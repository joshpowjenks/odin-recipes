    <h3>A sugar free sweet treat</h3>
   
    This silky, creamy, keto cheesecake has a tang of lemon and is the perfect sugar-free dessert for special occasions. You don't have to be an experienced baker to make this impressive and delicious treat â€” as a matter of fact, you don't even have to turn on the oven! Recipe serves 16.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    For the crust
    <ul>
        <li>230g almond flour</li>
        <li>110g butter, melted</li>
        <li>55g erythritol</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    For the filling
    <ul>
        <li>900g cream cheese</li>
        <li>240ml heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>110g erythritol</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Add all the ingredients for the crust into a bowl and mix until a sandy consistency.</li>
        <li>Put the mixture in a 9" (23 cm) springform pan. Using the bottom of a measuring cup or your fingers, press the crust into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Put it in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Add all the filling ingredients into a big bowl. Using a handheld or stand mixer beat the mixture for about 5 minutes or until it's a fluffy consistency. If you have a mixer with a paddle attachment, use this to whip the filling for a smoother, more consistent fluffy texture.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling over the crust and smooth into an even layer using a spatula or spoon.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and put in the fridge for at least three hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove the springform pan just before serving by running a thin-bladed knife around the edge to loosen the crust from the sides of the pan. Open the clamp and expand the sides of the pan and release the bottom.</li>
        <li>Top the cheesecake with toppings of your choice or serve it as it is.</li>
    </ol>
