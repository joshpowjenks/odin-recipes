    <h3>A wonderful low carb take on the Italian classic</h3>
   
    This keto lasagna recipe is easy to make and tastes just like the real thing. Great for diabetics watching their blood sugar levels, and anybody following a low carb or ketogenic diet.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    For the "pasta"
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>113g cream cheese</li>
        <li>20g parmesan cheese </li>
        <li>141g mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp onion powder</li>
    </ul>

    For the filling
    <ul>
        <li>452g ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tbsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
         <li>356ml marinara sauce</li>
        <li>85g mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>6 tbsp whole milk ricotta</li>
        <li>1 tsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>fresh basil for garnish</li>
    </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>

    For the "pasta"
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 190°c. Line a 9x13 baking dish with parchment paper. Grease the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, using a hand mixer, cream together the cream cheese and eggs.</li>
        <li>Next, add Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix until all ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Using a rubber spatula, fold in mozzarella cheese and mix until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Spread the mixture into the baking dish, forming a nice even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake on the middle rack for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the "noodles" are done baking, cool in the fridge for about 20 minutes and then cut into thirds. This makes three perfectly sized "noodle" layers for an 8.5 X 4.5 X 2.5 loaf pan.</li>
    </ol>

    For the filling
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, combine the ground beef, onion, oregano, garlic powder, dried basil and a pinch of salt. Cook until the meat is browned.</li>
        <li>Drain excess fat from pan and add 1 cup marinara sauce to meat. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    Putting it all together
    <ol>
        <li>Pour ¼ cup marinara sauce into bottom of loaf pan. Top with the first “noodle” layer</li>
        <li>Layer a third of the ground beef mixture. Top with ¼ cup mozzarella cheese and 3 tablespoon ricotta cheese, and cover with another “noodle” layer. Repeat these steps.</li>
        <li>Cover the top “noodle” layer with remaining meat sauce, marinara and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle Italian seasoning over top. Bake for 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
